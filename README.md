# Channel Saturator

A lightweight JSFX saturation effect, supported natively in Reaper or in any other DAW via the [ReaJS plugin](https://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/).

## Functionality

This lightweight saturation effect applies a soft clipping curve across four gain stages, to provide gentle (or not-so-gentle) saturation on individual channels. It defaults to relatively subtle settings which are meant to build up pleasing saturation when the effect is applied to many channels in a mix. It includes a Character selection which switches between the default soft saturation and a more edgy saturation on the final gain stage. It includes a volume trim so you can level match against the unmodified signal. This allows you to make clear decisions about whether the result sounds better, rather than louder.

## Installation

1. Download a zip file of this repository and unzip it.

2. Find the Reaper Resources directory. Under the Options menu click "Show REAPER’s resource path in explorer/finder…" to have Reaper find this folder for you.

3. Open the Effects directory within the Reaper Resources directory and copy the `Channel Saturator` file to that directory (or a subdirectory within.)

4. In Reaper, scan for new plugins.
